Lets Bloom be the led singer for some reason
Harmonix was not about her sadly even though she's the fairy of music and harmony
Is stunning, hello?
Listens to heavy metal music when she's sad
Has a sad backstory we actually care about (unlike Bloom)
Is such a legend
Should have pursued her music carrer in season 4 but RAI said never mind chile
Her voice is absolutely stunning, like bro watch this https://www.youtu.be/3pKGUowekII
