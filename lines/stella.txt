We love a powerful queen
Is literally the fairy of the sun, like hello? 
She's coming to snatch your wigs and burn your wings off 
Is kinda self centered but oh well-
Will give you a makeover for free just because she wants you to thrive
On wednesdays we all dress up like Bloom
if she combines her powers with Bloom they can incinerate you
