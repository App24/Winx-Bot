What is her herbal tea made of aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
She might be a drug dealer
Her only attack is that one attack with giant ivy that wraps everyone up for a while before they break out

I wonder if the plants talk behind her back
Can probably ask the plant in your living room about the drama that's going on in your household
